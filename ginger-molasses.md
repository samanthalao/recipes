## Story

These spiced ginger molasses cookies are a fall favorite—warm, chewy, and full of cozy spice flavors. They're the kind of cookies that make your kitchen smell amazing while they bake, and they pair perfectly with tea or coffee on a chilly afternoon.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp ground cloves
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper

### Wet Ingredients
- 3/4 cup butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup molasses
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

### For Rolling
- 2 tbsp coarse sugar (turbinado or regular sugar)

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. In a bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and black pepper.

3. In another bowl, cream together the softened butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.

4. Beat in the egg, molasses, and vanilla extract until combined.

5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

6. Place the coarse sugar in a shallow bowl.

7. Scoop dough into 1-inch balls and roll in coarse sugar.

8. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

9. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges are set but the centers are still slightly soft.

10. Let cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

## Notes

- These cookies will spread slightly and develop cracks on top, which is exactly what you want.
- Don't overbake—remove them when the edges are set but the center is still soft for a chewy texture.
- Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
- The dough can be made ahead and refrigerated for up to 3 days before baking.
- For extra warmth, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to the spice mixture.
