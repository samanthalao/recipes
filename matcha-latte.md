## Story

A silky, smooth matcha latte is the perfect way to start your morning. This traditional Japanese beverage has become a global favorite for its earthy flavor and calming properties. This version uses a simple technique to ensure a lump-free, creamy matcha drink every time.

## Ingredients

- 1 tsp matcha powder
- 2 tbsp hot water (not boiling, around 70-80°C)
- 1 cup milk of choice (dairy, oat, almond, or soy)
- 1 tbsp honey or sugar (optional)

## Recipe

1. Sift the matcha powder into a bowl to remove any lumps.

2. Pour the hot water into the bowl with matcha powder.

3. Using a matcha whisk (chasen) or small wire whisk, whisk in a circular motion until the matcha is fully dissolved and frothy.

4. Heat your milk gently in a saucepan or using a milk frother.

5. Pour the matcha mixture into your cup, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top.

6. Pour the hot milk into the cup and stir gently to combine.

7. Top with additional foam if desired.

8. Serve immediately while hot.

## Notes

- Don't use boiling water, as it can make the matcha taste bitter. Aim for water around 70-80°C.
- For a cold matcha latte, whisk the matcha with a small amount of room temperature water first, then add cold milk and ice.
- Quality matcha powder makes a huge difference. Look for ceremonial grade for the best taste.
- If you don't have a traditional matcha whisk, a small electric frother or even a regular whisk will work fine.
