## Story

A chocolate souffle is an impressive yet surprisingly simple dessert that never fails to impress. Light, airy, and intensely chocolatey, this dish proves that elegant desserts don't need to be complicated. The key is respecting the technique and your oven.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz dark chocolate, chopped
- 4 tbsp butter
- 4 egg yolks
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 5 egg whites
- 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
- 1/4 tsp salt
- Powdered sugar for dusting
- Butter and cocoa powder for ramekins

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly butter four 6-oz ramekins and dust with cocoa powder.

2. Melt the dark chocolate and butter together in a double boiler or microwave (in 30-second intervals, stirring between each).

3. In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with 2 tbsp sugar until pale, about 2-3 minutes.

4. Fold the melted chocolate into the egg yolk mixture until combined.

5. In a separate, clean bowl, beat the egg whites with cream of tartar and salt until soft peaks form.

6. Gradually add the remaining 2 tbsp sugar while beating until stiff peaks form.

7. Gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture in two additions, being careful not to deflate the whites.

8. Divide the mixture among the prepared ramekins, filling to about 3/4 full.

9. Bake for 22-25 minutes. The souffle should be puffed and set on the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center.

10. Dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately.

## Notes

- Don't open the oven door while the souffle is baking—sudden temperature changes can cause it to fall.
- The souffle is best served immediately, as it will deflate as it cools.
- You can prepare the batter up to 2 hours ahead, but bake just before serving.
- For extra richness, serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side.
