## Story

Savory scones are a wonderful alternative to sweet pastries, and when loaded with cheese, they become irresistible. These tender, flaky scones have pockets of melty cheddar cheese throughout. They're perfect served warm with butter, or as part of a casual brunch spread.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp white pepper
- 6 tbsp cold butter, cubed
- 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese, grated
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1 egg (for egg wash)

## Recipe

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, and white pepper.

3. Add the cold butter cubes to the flour mixture. Using a pastry cutter or fork, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.

4. Fold in the grated cheddar cheese, reserving a small handful for topping.

5. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk. Gently stir until the dough just comes together. Do not overmix.

6. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and gently pat into a circle about 1 inch thick.

7. Cut the dough into 8 wedges (like a pie).

8. Place the scones on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

9. Beat the egg with a fork and brush over the tops of each scone. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.

10. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until golden brown.

11. Serve warm.

## Notes

- The key to fluffy scones is to not overwork the dough. Mix just until the ingredients come together.
- Keep the butter cold for the best texture and flakiness.
- Use a sharp cheddar for more pronounced cheese flavor.
- These scones are best eaten fresh, but can be reheated gently in the oven.
