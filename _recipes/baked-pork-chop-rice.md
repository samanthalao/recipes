## Story

Hello! This blog documents the meals created by my husband L and me - mostly L's creations. They are often unconventional, and often driven by what we have on hand and what's on sale. The meals blend western and eastern ingredients and techniques. Fusion cuisine, I guess.

At times, I question L's creative direction to swap ingredients for the sake of convenience. You can often hear me saying "are you sureee….?" "usually this ingredient is added…." But more times than not, the dish, though untraditional, turns out delicious and has me going back for seconds.

Today L made baked pork chop rice. A classic hong kong diner dish that I grew up eating on our family trips to HK.

### The Traditional Way

Traditionally, it's pan fried pork chop, topped on a bed of fried rice, scrambled with egg. On top of the pork shop is a tomato based sauce with mozzarella cheese on top. You cook the fried rice and pork chop separately, and then combine them with the rest of the components and finish it off in the oven.

### L's Shortcut

Instead of making the tomato based sauce from scratch, L used jarred pasta sauce (it was Rao's, on sale). And instead of mozzarella, we used pecorino & parmesan because that's what we had in the fridge. Though I would recommend mozzarella. The pecorino & parmesan flavors were a bit too sharp for this dish.

## Ingredients

### Pork Chop
- 1 lb pork chop

### Marinade
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 cup shaoxing wine
- 1/2 tsp five spice powder

### Breading
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup flour

### Rice
- 1.5 cups rice
- 2 eggs
- Salt
- White pepper
- 1/2 onion
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/2 cup frozen peas

### Sauce & Cheese
- 12 oz marinara sauce
- 1 cup mozzarella

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

2. If the pork chop is thicker than an inch, cut it in half. Pound it with a rolling pin or metal ladle to flatten.

3. Marinate the pork chop for 30 minutes with soy sauce, shaoxing wine, and five spice powder.

4. Prepare your breading station with 2 bowls—one with flour and one with beaten egg.

5. Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet. Add the onion and garlic, stir-frying for a few minutes. Add the rice and stir-fry for a few more minutes. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt. Pour the eggs into the skillet and scramble. Add the frozen peas, salt, and white pepper.

6. Remove the pork chop from the marinade. Dredge it in flour, then egg, then flour again.

7. In another skillet, heat a thin layer of oil. Sear the pork chop on both sides. It's okay if the inside isn't fully cooked.

8. Slice the pork chop into strips (like katsu).

9. Place the sliced pork chop on top of the fried rice.

10. Pour the marinara sauce over the pork chop, spreading it evenly.

11. Add cheese on top.

12. Place the skillet in the oven at 350°F. Cook for about 15 minutes or until the pork chop reaches an internal temperature of 160°F.

## Notes

What I love about this dish, is the use of the cast iron skillet. Because it can be used on both the stove and the oven, there's one less dish you need to wash! I also liked how there were bits of the rice that got all nice and crispy at the bottom of the pan.
