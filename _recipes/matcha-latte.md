## Story

My first memory with matcha was at Mitsuwa - a japanese supermarket with a food court inside. There was a small shop in the food court that served matcha drinks, I don't even remember the name, and my sister would often buy an iced matcha (no milk). During the covid shutdown, I got into making matcha lattes at home. Most recently, we hosted a few home cafes this fall/winter season where we served iced and hot matcha lattes! 

(Batch making the matcha concentrate was a game changer - it saved soo much time & no hand whisking involved, which probably saved my hand from cramping - let me know if you'd like the recipe for that!)

## Ingredients

- 1-2 tsp matcha powder (2-3 g)
- 30 mL warm water (&le 175 F)
- 200 mL milk of choice (suggest dairy or oat)
- 1 tsp sugar/simple syrup (optional)

## Recipe

1. Sift the matcha powder into a bowl.

2. Pour the hot water into the bowl with matcha powder.

3. Using a matcha whisk (chasen), whisk in an M shape motion until the matcha is fully dissolved.

4. Heat your milk in the microwave (do not exceed 150 F if using dairy milk). Add sweeter to the milk (optional). Froth your milk using an electric hand frother. 

5. Pour the whisked matcha into your cup, then pour the milk.

7. Serve immediately while hot.

## Notes

- Don't use boiling water, as it can make the matcha taste bitter. 
- For a cold matcha latte, whisk the matcha with a small amount of room temperature water first. Pour in cold milk and ice into your cup, followed by the whisked matcha for a layered effect. (Tip: when pouring the matcha, aim to pour on the ice to ensure the layered effect)
- Use ceremonial grade matcha for the best taste.
- If you don't have a matcha whisk, a small electric frother works.
