## Story

This refreshing yuzu oolong tea combines the delicate floral notes of oolong with the bright, citrusy flavor of yuzu. It's a drink that feels luxurious yet simple, perfect for a quiet morning or afternoon break. The tartness of yuzu balances beautifully with the complexity of a good oolong tea.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups water
- 2 tbsp oolong tea leaves
- 3 tbsp yuzu juice (fresh or bottled)
- 1 tbsp honey or agave
- 1 tsp yuzu zest (optional)
- Ice (for serving cold)

## Recipe

1. Heat water to about 80-85°C (not quite boiling).

2. Place oolong tea leaves in a teapot or infuser.

3. Pour the hot water over the tea leaves and let steep for 3-4 minutes.

4. Strain the tea into a pitcher or teapot.

5. Add the yuzu juice and honey, stirring until the honey is dissolved.

6. Pour into cups over ice, or serve hot if preferred.

7. Garnish with yuzu zest if available.

## Notes

- Oolong tea can be brewed at lower temperatures than black tea, which brings out more delicate flavors.
- If you can't find fresh yuzu juice, bottled yuzu juice works wonderfully and is widely available online or in Asian markets.
- You can adjust the yuzu to tea ratio based on your preference for citrus intensity.
- This tea is also delicious served cold over ice on a hot day.
- Yuzu paste can be used as a substitute—just dissolve 1-2 teaspoons in the hot tea.
